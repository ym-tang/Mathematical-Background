### Here’re what I’ve learned and read for the last two years. Currently, I’m learning Shimura varieties (especially concrete examples through Lan’s book) and p-adic Hodge theory.

- In the first year of master’s degree, I spent most of my time on **algebraic geometry and number theory**, including first four chapters of Hartshone, basic etale cohomology and class field theory.

- From around October last year, I started to learn theories about **modular forms and modular curves**, with references like Diamond and Im’s survey [1], Diamond’s book GTM228, Shimura’s book [2], etc. I got to know basic knowledges about reduction of modular curves, Deligne-Rapoport’s moduli interpretation, Tate curve, Eichler-Shimura isomorphism, associated Galois representations and Atkin-Lehner theory. Furthermore, on **Galois representations** associated with modular forms, I read some materials like Serre’s Duke 54 paper [3] (on the of modularity of Galois representations over finite fields) and Ribet’s 1976 invention paper [4] (construct Galois representations by congruences of modular forms). And recently, I found that Ribet and Stein’s note [5] on **Serre modularity conjecture** is very well written with rich content, and I plan to read it more in the rest of the year.

- About **elliptic curves**, I scanned through Silverman’s textbook [6] (with some proof omitted). Then I took some time to understand results on complex multiplication and construction of Heegner points. I got to know some other important results like Serre’s open image theorem, surjectivity of Galois representations from E[p] (E is some elliptic curve without CM) by Serre’s classical book [7] and some other articles. I’m especially curious about Iwasawa theory for elliptic curves, arithmetic duality, and the BSD conjecture, though didn’t go along very deeper into them. And I used to feel the increase of Modell-Weil rank of elliptic curves after field extension is an interesting question, such as Silverman’s proof on the independence of Heegner points from different quadratic fields, and read some stuff about this.

- Between January and March this year, I started to read **Mazur’s Eisenstein ideal paper** with the help of the website [8] and some notes from B. Conrad’s seminar. I understood his proof about rational torsion points of elliptic curves over Q (and another different proof for this his gave next year), but didn’t read through the rest of his paper. During this process, I enriched knowledge about **Abelian varieties and Neron models**.

- About three months ago, I found **slopes and congruences of modular forms** a rather interesting topic. At then I went into Ribet’s 1976 invent paper [4] mentioned above, in which he made heavy use of congruences between Eisenstein series and cuspidal forms to construct Galois representations. Then I read some further survey articles like Gouvêa’s survey [9] on slopes, Emerton’s [12] and Schraen’s [15] on p-adic modular forms. I was also very interested in **more recent development due to Philloni**.
- I learned basic definitions of **Shimura varieties** by Milne’s book and am learning more concrete examples through K. W. Lan’s book. I’m especially interested in arithmetic applications of their cohomology, like **Scholtz’s construction of Galois representations from them (perfectoid modular curve)**. For the next 1 or 2 months, I’m going to finish the rest of Milne’s book I haven’t read, including reductions and canonical models. In fact, I plan to write **my thesis** about some classical works on Shimura varieties like Ribet's invent 100 paper.

- Another topic I intend to learn in the next two semesters is **p-adic Hodge theory**, as long as I find them appears frequently when I’m reading papers and act as a powerful tool to prove many things. For example, as Dalawat said in [13], proofs in [4] could be improved by Faltings’ result on crystalline representations.
