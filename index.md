### Here’re what I’ve learned and read for the last two years. Currently, I’m focusing on arithmetic applications of Shimura varieties and p-adic modular forms.

- In the first year of master’s degree, I spent most of my time on **algebraic geometry and number theory**, including first four chapters of Hartshone, basic etale cohomology and class field theory.

- From around October last year, I started to learn the theories about **modular forms and modular curves**, with references like Diamond and Im’s survey [1], Diamond’s book GTM228, Shimura’s book [2], etc. On **Galois representations** associated with modular forms, I read some materials like Serre’s Duke 54 paper [3] (on the of modularity of Galois representations over finite fields) and Ribet’s 1976 invention paper [4] (on the relation between Bernoulli numbers and class number of cyclotomic fields). And recently, I found that Ribet and Stein’s note [5] on Serre modularity conjecture is very well written with rich content, and I plan to read it more in the rest of the year.

- About **elliptic curves**, I scanned through Silverman’s textbook [6] (with some proof omitted). Then I took some time to understand results on complex multiplication and construction of Heegner points. I got to know some other important results like Serre’s open image theorem, surjectivity of representations from E[p] (E is some elliptic curve without CM) by Serre’s classical book [7] and some other articles. I didn’t go along very deeper into BSD conjecture, arithmetic duality and other related topics. But I feel the increase of Modell-Weil rank of elliptic curves after field extension is an interesting question, such as Silverman’s proof on the independence of Heegner points from different quadratic fields. Maybe later I could read more stuff about this.

- Between January and March this year, I started to read **Mazur’s Eisenstein ideal paper** with the help of the website [8] and some notes from B. Conrad’s seminar. I mainly focused on his discussion about rational torsion points of elliptic curves over Q (and another different proof for this his gave next year), and didn’t read through the rest of his paper. During this process, I enriched my knowledge about **Abelian varieties and Neron models**.

- Two or three months ago, I found **slopes and congruences of modular forms** a rather interesting topic. At then I went into Ribet’s 1976 invent paper [4] mentioned above. In that paper, he used congruence between Eisenstein series and cuspidal forms to construct certain extensions of cyclotomic fields, which in turn asserts the existence of certain parts of its class group. Then I read some further survey articles like Gouvêa’s survey [9] on slopes, and Emerton’s [12] on p-adic modular forms. And I am going to learn Katz’s formulation of p-adic modular forms in [11] and Coleman’s eigencurve theory in the next two months.

- Another topic I intend to learn in the next two semesters is **p-adic Hodge theory**, as long as I find them appears frequently when I’m reading papers and act as a powerful tool to prove many things. For example, as Dalawat said in [13], proofs in [4] could be improved by Faltings’ result on crystalline representations.
